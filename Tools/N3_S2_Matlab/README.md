This directory contains code for simulating a particular Caffe CNN in Matlab.  The motivation is to have an alternative to the somewhat computationally expensive procedure of extracting a tile centered on every pixel and then running each tile through the CNN individually.  Since adjacent tiles have many pixels in common it is somewhat computationally thriftier to convolve the Caffe weights with the entire image.
